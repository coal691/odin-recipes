    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium green bell pepper (about ½ cup)</li>
            <li>1 medium tomato quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water plus additional water as needed for braising the tofu</li>
            <li>2 chipotle chilies plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ancho chile powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano (see notes)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>  
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Tofu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil or rice bran oil</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package extra firm tofu pressed, cut into 8 slices</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>To Make the Marinade</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a food processor, combine bell pepper, tomato, onion, water, chipotle chilies and adobo sauce, garlic, red wine vinegar, ancho chile powder, cumin, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste (I like ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper). Pulse until the marinade is slightly chunky and thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>To Make the Tofu</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil until shimmering. Working in batches if necessary, carefully place the tofu in the pan, flip occasionally, and cook until the tofu is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Roughly chop the tofu, or pulse the tofu in a food processor until the tofu is roughly in ¼ inch pieces. Place in a bowl and add the marinade. Cover and allow to sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>To cook the tofu, heat a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add the marinated tofu and any remaining marinade. Add ¼ cup water and bring to a boil. Add additional water to desired consistency. (I like there to be additional liquid for serving.) Reduce to simmering. Cook until the tofu throughout heated, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ol>
